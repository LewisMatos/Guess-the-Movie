quotes_2onÂ Andy: "God, Friday, when I went home, I really wanted an egg-salad sandwich.  And I was just obsessing about it and I was like: 'Man, I'm gonna make one of those.'  So-so, Saturday I went out and got, like, a dozen eggs and I boiled them all and then I just I-I spent, I don't know, probably three hours... like three and a half hours making you know, the mayonnaise and the onions and paprika and, you know, all the accoutrement.  And then by the time I was done I just really didn't feel like eating it."Cal: "I can imagine."Andy: "And I didn't have any bread.  So, you know, it was pretty good.
