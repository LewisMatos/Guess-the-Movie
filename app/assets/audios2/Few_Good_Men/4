quotes_4onÂ Jessup: "You see, Danny, I can deal with the bullets and the bombs and the blood. I don't want money and I don't want medals. What I do want, is for you to stand there in that faggoty white uniform and with your Harvard mouth, extend me some bleeping courtesy. You gotta ask me nicely."~ ~
