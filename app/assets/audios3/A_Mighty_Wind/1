quotes_1onÂ Jonathan Steinbloom (Bob Balaban): "She was very protective.  You could say she was overly protective.  I just like to think she cared about me.  Which she did, a lot. And I was a member of the chess team.  And whenever we would have chess tournaments, I had to wear a protective helmet.  I had to wear a football helmet.  Now, who knows what she was thinking?  Maybe she thought that we might have fallen maybe and impaled our heads on a pointy bishop or something, I don't know."~ ~
