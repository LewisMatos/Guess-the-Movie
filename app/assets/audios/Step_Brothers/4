quotes_4onÂ Dale Doback (John C. Reilly): "Dad, we're men, okay?  That means a few things.  We like to shit with tho door open.  We talk about pussy.  We go on riverboat-gambling trips.  We make our own beef jerky.  That's what we do.  And now that is all wrecked."Dr. Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins): "We literally have never done any of those things."~ ~
