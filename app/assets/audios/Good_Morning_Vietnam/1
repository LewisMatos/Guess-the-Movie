quotes_1onÂ Dan 'The Man' Levitan: "The Armed Forces sincerely regrets any inconvenience due to luggage lost on transport carriers.  Personal missing luggage... that should be personnel missing luggage are asked to drop a card to Major Gerald Kleiner over at the Fifth.  The card should be no larger than four by five inches and should describe the contents of your duffel.  Major Kleiner requests that you do not describe your duffel as all duffels look alike."~ ~
