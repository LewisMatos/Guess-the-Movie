2onÂ Mr. Turkentine (David Battley): "We have here nitric acid, glycerine, and a special mixture of my own.  Together it's horrible  dangerous stuff, blows you up.  But mixed together in the right way, as only I know how, what do you think it makes?"Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum): "I don't know, sir."Mr. Turkentine: "Of course you don't know.  You don't know because only I know.  If you knew and I didn't know, then you'd be teaching me instead of me teaching you.  And for a student to teach his teacher it's presumptuous and rude.  Do I make myself clear? "Charlie: "Yes, sir."Mr. Turkentine: "Good."~ ~
