Now, Biff, I never noticed that, uh, the car had any blind spot before when I would drive it.  Hi, son."Biff: "Well, what are you blind, McFly?  It's there.  How else do you explain that wreck out there?"George: "Now, Biff, um, can I... can I assume that your, uh, insurance is gonna pay for the damage?"Biff: "My insurance?  It's your car.  Your insurance should pay for it.  I wanna know who's gonna pay for this.  I spilled beer all over when that car smashed into me.  Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?"~ ~
