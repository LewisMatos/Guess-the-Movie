quotes_4onÂ Randy Dupree (Owen Wilson): "Listen, we're all adults here.  You're newlyweds.  Making love's big part of that.  You're supposed to explore each other.  I git it.  Come on, if this situation's gonna work, we've gotta be honest with each other.  Now, go on.  Enjoy yourselves.  I'm not gonna listen.  Hump away.  Go on, get out of here.  Good night."Carl: "Okay."~ ~
