3onÂ James Earl Jones, as famous 60's writer Terrance Mann, talking to Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner): "The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball.  America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers.  It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time.  This field, this game, is a part of our past, Ray. It reminds us of all that once was good, and that could be again.  Oh people will come, Ray.  People will most definitely come."~ ~
