4onÂ Jean Hagen: "You mean it's gonna say up on the screen that I don't talk and sing for myself? Of course, what do you think? But they can't do that! I'm sorry, but it's already done. There's a whole publicity campaign being planned. Publicity? They can't make a fool outta Lina Lamont! They can't make a laughing stock outta Lina Lamont! What do they think I am, dumb or something? Why I make more money than...than...Calvin Coolidge!  Put together!"~ ~
