They already handed out the girls medals this morning."Jimmy MacElroy(Jon Heder): "Shut up, Michaels.  That was textbook execution.  Same scores I beat you with in Oslo."Chazz: "Hey, I was on quaaludes.  I don't even remember Oslo.  But I remember Boston, and that victory was as sweet as the cream pie for which the town was named."~ ~
