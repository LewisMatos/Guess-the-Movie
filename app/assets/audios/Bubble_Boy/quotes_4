4onÂ Jimmy: "At Sixteen I didn't get a car, but I did get an electrical rock-music guitar!  (Singing) I con't believe the things I found.  I need to find my way.  I'm lost, I'm lost.  I do believe I'm living in the Land Of the Lost.  (Plays riff)  I'm living in the Land.  Living in the Land.  (Plays riff)  Livind in the Land Of the Lost.  I was so happy.  I had everything a boy could ever want."~ ~
