quotes_5onÂ Mike: "Hell, every guy's got his dream.  Am I right?  Between you, me and the wall, I had a doozy myself last night.  Get this, a corn-fed harvest mouse, a hooker, a nun, a Flemish peasent woman, whips, chains, whistles, yo-yo-, a circus midget, my grandmother riding by on a bicycle giving me the finger, and a duck.  Now, I don't know--  Are you crying?"~ ~
