3onÂ Ben (Michael Rapaport): "You know what your problem is, Hitch?  You're all about the short game.  You pick your shots based on what you see first not what's, uh, necessarily best for you in the long run."Hitch: "Well, all of us are not married to the woman of our dreams and about to have a baby.  You know, I'm very happy for you.  Just not meant for everybody.  So please just leave me to my hot, sweaty, totally varied, experimental short game."Ben: "I was jut talking about pool, but whatever."Hitch: "Yeah, okay."~ ~
