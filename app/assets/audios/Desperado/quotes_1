1onÂ Buscemi: "I was visiting a bar there, not unlike this one. They serve beer, not quite as good as this but close. And in walks the biggest mexican I have ever seen. Big as bleep! Just walks right in like he owns the place, and nobody knew quite what to make of him or quite what to think. But there he was and in he walked."~ ~
