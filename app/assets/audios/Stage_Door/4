quotes_4onÂ Seth: "Notorious B.I.G. said it best:  Either your slinging crack rock, or you got a wicked jump shot.'  Nobody wants to work for it anybore.  There's no honor in taking the after school job at Mickey D's.  Honor's in the dollar, kid.  So I went the white boy way of slinging crack rock.  I became a stock broker."~ ~
