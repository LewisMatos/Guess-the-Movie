3onÂ Romey: "What the hell is your problem Christie? Why are you always such a nasty bitch? You get some sort of sick pleasure from torturing other people? I mean yeah, okay, So Michelle and I did make up some lame story. We only did it because we wanted you to treat us like human beings, but you know what I finally realized? I don't care if you like us, because we don't like you. You're a bad person with an ugly heart, and we don't give a flying bleep what you think."~ ~
