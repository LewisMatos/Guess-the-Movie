3onÂ George Menschell (Paul Dooley): "One night in 1960, I'll never forget this, uh, we were ar a hootenanny and we were jamming with the Klapper Family.  And all of the sudden, I heard it.  The sound that I'd been thinking about.  It was just...  The harmonics were amazing.  I thought, well, there's five of us, there's four of them.  It's a neuf-tet.  And it was there, just in a moment, it was all there.  The neuf-tet sound.  Well, this thing clicked with the Klappers too, so we joined forces and we became The Mainstreet Singers."~ ~
