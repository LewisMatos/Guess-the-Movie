on Jonathan Steinbloom (Bob Balaban): "She was very protective.  You could say she was overly protective.  I just like to think she cared about me.  Which she did, a lot. And I was a member of the chess team.  And whenever we would have chess tournaments, I had to wear a protective helmet.  I had to wear a football helmet.  Now, who knows what she was thinking?  Maybe she thought that we might have fallen maybe and impaled our heads on a pointy bishop or something, I don't know."~ ~
on George Menschell (Paul Dooley): "One night in 1960, I'll never forget this, uh, we were ar a hootenanny and we were jamming with the Klapper Family.  And all of the sudden, I heard it.  The sound that I'd been thinking about.  It was just...  The harmonics were amazing.  I thought, well, there's five of us, there's four of them.  It's a neuf-tet.  And it was there, just in a moment, it was all there.  The neuf-tet sound.  Well, this thing clicked with the Klappers too, so we joined forces and we became The Mainstreet Singers."~ ~
on David Kantor (Jim Ortlieb): "In 1971, after the breakup of The Main Street Singers, Chuck Wiseman moved up to San Francisco where he started a retail business with his brothers Howard and Dell.  The Three Wiseman's Sex Emporium.  It was very successful for a year until they were sued over something having to do with a box of benwa balls."~ ~
on Mickey Crabbe (Catherine O'Hara): "I'd... I'd like to think that... that Mitch would agree to do this with me.  Because I already said yes.  And I can't do it alone, so...  No, I didn't... I didn't think this through.  Should've talked to him beforehand, you know, but I haven't talked to him in so long."~ ~
on Terry Bohner (John Michael Higgins): "There had been abuse in my family, but it was mostly musical in nature."~ ~
