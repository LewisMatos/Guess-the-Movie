quotes_3onÂ Jules: "bleep damn Jimmy!  This some serious gourmet bleep!  Me and Vincent woulda been satisfied with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice, right?  And he springs this serious gourmet bleep on us.  What flavor is this?"Jimmy: "Knock it off, Julie."Jules: "What?"Jimmy: "I don't need you to tell me how bleepin' good my coffee is, ok?  I'm the one who buys it.  I know how good it is.  When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys bleep.  I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it. But you know what's on my mind right now?  It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.  It's the dead nigger in my gararge."~ ~
