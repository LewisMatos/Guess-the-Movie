quotes_1onÂ : "You're overwrought, Madame.  I've opened the window for you.  Some air will do you good.  Why don't you go?  Why don't you leave Mandalay?  He doesn't need you.  He's got his memories.  He doesn't love you, he wants to be alone again with her.  You've nothing to stay for.  You've nothing to live for, really, have you?  Look down there, it would be easy, isn't it? Why don't you? Why don't you? Go on...go on...don't be afraid..."~ ~
