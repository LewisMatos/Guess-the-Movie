2onÂ Papa Elf: "Another... Another interesting, uh, elfism:  Uh, there are only three jobs available to an elf.  The first is making shoes at night, while, you know, while the old cobbler sleeps.  You can bake cookies in a tree.  As you can imagine, it's dangerous having an oven in an oak tree during the dry season.  But the third job, uh, some call it, uh, 'The Show', or... or 'The Big Dance'.  It's the profession that every elf aspires to, and that is to build toys in santa's workshop."~ ~
