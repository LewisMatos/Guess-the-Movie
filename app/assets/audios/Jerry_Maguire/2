quotes_2onÂ Seth: "I remember there was this photograph of one of the groundskeepers next to his Ferrrari.  Blew my mind.  You see bleep like that, and it just plants seeds, makes you think it's possible, even easy.  And then you turn on the TV, and there's just more of it.  The 87 million dollar lottery winner.  That kid actor that just made $20 million on his last movie.  That internet stock that shot through the roof.  You could have made millions on it if you'd just got in early.  And that's exactly what I wanted to do: get in.  I didn't want to be an innovator.  I just wanted to make the quick and easy buck.  I just wanted in."~ ~
