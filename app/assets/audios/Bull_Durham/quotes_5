5onÂ : "Well I believe in the soul... the cock...the pussy... the small of a woman's back...  the hangin' curveball... high fiber... good scotch... that the novels of Susan Sontag are self-indulgent overrated crap... I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.  I believe there ought to be a Constitutional amendment outlawing Astroturf and the designated hitter.   I believe in the sweet spot, soft core pornography, opening your presents Christmas morning rather than Christmas Eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days.  Goodnight."~ ~
