1onÂ : "Maybe we'll decide to get buried here.": "Well, you'd better come with me, Duke.  I'm planning to be buried in the petrified forest.  You know, I've been evolving a theory about that, that would interest you.  It's the graveyard of the civilization that's shot from under us, the world of outmoded ideas...they're all so many dead stumps in the desert.  That's where I belong. So do you, Duke. You're the last great apostle of rugged individualism."~ ~
