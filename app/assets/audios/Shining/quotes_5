5onÂ Dick Hallorann: "I can remember when I was a little boy my grandmother and I could hold conversations entirely without ever opening our mouths.  She called it 'shining'.  And for a long time I thought it was just the two of us that had 'the shine' to us.  Just like you probably thought you was the only one.  But there are other folks, though mostly they don't know it, or don't believe it."~ ~
