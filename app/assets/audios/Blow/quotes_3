3onÂ Fred Jung (Ray Liotta): "Sometimes you're flush and sometimes you're bust, and when you're up, it's never as good as it seems, and when you're down, you never think you're gonna be up again.  But life goes on.  Remember that.  Money isn't real George.  It doesn't matter.  It only seems like it does."~ ~
