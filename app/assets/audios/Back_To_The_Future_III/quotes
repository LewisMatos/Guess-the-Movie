on Dr. 'Doc' Emmett Brown: "Howdy Doody Time?"~ ~
on Doc: "'Dear Marty:  If my colculations are correct, you will receive this lettre immediately after you saw the DeLorean struck by lightning.  First, let me assure you tha I am alive and well.  I've been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885.  The lightning bolt that hit the DeLorean caused a gigawatt overload which scrambled the time curcuits, activated the flux capacitor and sent me back to 1885.  The overload shorted out the time circuits and destroyed the flying circuits.  Unfortunately the car will never fly again.'  It actually flew?"Marty: "Yeah, well, you had a hover conversion done in the early 21st century."Doc: "Incredible."~ ~
on Doc: "'I set myself up as a blacksmith as a front while I attempted to repair the damage to the time circuits.  Unfortunately, this proved impossible because suitable replacement parts will not be invented until 1947.  However, I've gotten quite adept at shoeing horses and fixing wagons.'  1885!  Amazing!  I actually end up as a blacksmith in the Old West."~ ~
on Doc: "'And please take care of Einstein for me.'  Einstein?"Marty: "He's your dog, Doc.  Einstein.  It's what you call your dog in 1985."Doc: "'I know you will give him a good home.  Remember to walk him twice a day and that he olny likes caned dog food.  These are my wishes.  Please respect them and follow them.'"~ ~
on Doc: "'And so, Marty, I now say farewell and wish you Godspeed.  You've been a good, kind and loyal friend to me, and you made a real difference in my life.  I will always treasure our relationship and think on you with fond memories, warm feelings and a special place in my heart.  Your friend in time, Doc.  Emmett L. Brown, September 1st, 1885.'  I never knew I could write anything so touching."Marty: "I know.  I know, Doc.  It's beautiful."~ ~
