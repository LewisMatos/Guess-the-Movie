2onÂ Doc: "'Dear Marty:  If my colculations are correct, you will receive this lettre immediately after you saw the DeLorean struck by lightning.  First, let me assure you tha I am alive and well.  I've been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885.  The lightning bolt that hit the DeLorean caused a gigawatt overload which scrambled the time curcuits, activated the flux capacitor and sent me back to 1885.  The overload shorted out the time circuits and destroyed the flying circuits.  Unfortunately the car will never fly again.'  It actually flew?"Marty: "Yeah, well, you had a hover conversion done in the early 21st century."Doc: "Incredible."~ ~
