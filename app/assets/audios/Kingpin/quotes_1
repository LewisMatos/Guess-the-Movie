1onÂ Ernie McCracken (Bill Murry): "It all comes down to this roll. Roy Munson, a man-child, with a dream to topple bowling giant Ernie McCracken. If he strikes, he's the 1979 Odor-Eaters Champion. He's got one foot in the frying pan and one in the pressure cooker. Believe me, as a bowler, I know that right about now, your bladder feels like an overstuffed vacuum cleaner bag and your butt is kinda like an about-to-explode bratwurst."Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson): "Hey! Do you mind? I wasn't talking when you were bowling."Ernie McCracken: "Was I talking out loud? Was I? Sorry. Good luck."~ ~
