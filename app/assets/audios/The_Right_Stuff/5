quotes_5onÂ Liaison Man: "Word will get out, Major.  Maybe not to the press, not to the general public.  But pretty soon, every fighter jock, every rocket ace, every rat-racer in the country will be headed this way.  Each one of them, wanting to push the outside of the envelope and get to the top of the pyramid."~ ~
