The sound barrier is a farm that you can buy in the sky.  They'll tell you the controls will freeze up.  You can't budge the stick.  They'll tell you anybody tries to break it will auger in.  Well, now, maybe it can't be broke.  Then again... maybe it can.  Maybe it can only be broke for a specified sum."~ ~
