quotes_3onÂ Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard): "Well, I'll tell you what.  Half these engineers have never been off the ground, you know.  I mean, they're liable to tell you that the sound barrier's a brick wall in the sky.  It'll rip your ears off if you try to go through it.  If you ask me, I don't even believe the damn thing even exists."~ ~
