on Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens: "So tonight, when you're wondering what to say, or how you look, or whether or not she likes you, just remember, she is already out with you.  That means she said yes when she could have said no.  That means she made a plan when she could have just blown you off.  So that means it is no longer your job to try to make her like you.  It is your job not to mess it up."~ ~
on Sara (Eva Mendes): "Besides, relationships are for people that are just waiting for something to come along."Max (Adam Arkin): "Ah, spoken like a true cynic."Sara: "I'm not a cynic.  I'm a realist."Max: "You are a realist masquerading as a cynic who is secretly an optimist."~ ~
on Ben (Michael Rapaport): "You know what your problem is, Hitch?  You're all about the short game.  You pick your shots based on what you see first not what's, uh, necessarily best for you in the long run."Hitch: "Well, all of us are not married to the woman of our dreams and about to have a baby.  You know, I'm very happy for you.  Just not meant for everybody.  So please just leave me to my hot, sweaty, totally varied, experimental short game."Ben: "I was jut talking about pool, but whatever."Hitch: "Yeah, okay."~ ~
on Sara: "Casey, you're not sick.  You're single.  You just have to relax and enjoy the ride."Casey (Julie Ann Emery): "I haven't been ridden in months."~ ~
on Hitch: "I'm gonna go get those girls, I'm gonna bring 'em over here, we're gonna have a conversation like human beings.  Then you're gonna go home, and I'm gonna take 'em back to my apartment."Ben: "Well, that sounds like for me.  But, you know, you might want to get in line, pal."~ ~
